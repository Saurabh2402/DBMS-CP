* Keywords of SQL are made case insensitive

* command should end with semicolon - else it will display error

* defining primary key is compulsory, during create table - if not defined will display error

* We are creating Different Files for different tables

* How SCHEMA FILE looks: 
      *Students*
      <<
      pk: id
      id int
      name varchar 30
      dob date
      percent decimal 4 2
      >>

How the data file(table) of Students.txt will look like -
    <100,SY,24-02-2001,66.3,>
    <103,SS,24-02-2001,92.4,>
    <104,IJ,24-02-2001,76.8,>
